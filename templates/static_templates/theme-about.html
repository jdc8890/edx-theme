        <h2>About Inversus</h2>
        
        <p>Inversus is an immersive online learning platform made exclusively for the medical students at The Johns Hopkins University.</p>
        <p>This is not your typical e-lecture.</p>
        <p>Inversus takes online learning to a new level. Through this platform, the traditional one-hour lecture is broken into 5 to 10 minute clips that are interspersed with questions so that students can reinforce the knowledge they are learning, as they learn. The instructor can monitor the students’ understanding of the material and adjust their teaching accordingly.</p>
        <p>Because students learn the material on their own time, class time is dedicated to application of concepts. Students take a more active role in their learning, and learn from their peers by participating in small group clinical case discussions. Professors act as a guide as students lead discussions. This teaching method is also known as “flipped classroom.”</p>
        <p>Inversus was created by Joshua Cohen and Regina de Luna (School of Medicine Class of 2017). It is powered by the OpenEdX platform. </p>

        <p><strong>Where does the name Inversus come from?</strong><br />
        The name Inversus comes from “Situs Inversus” a medical condition where the major structures of the thorax and abdomen are flipped. It alludes to our goal of flipping the medical school classroom.</p>

        <h2>Careers</h2>
        <p>
          Technology is disrupting higher education.  We believe universities can benefit from this if it's done right.  Supporting basic education and computer science research is core to what we do.  We also believe
          that universities should be in control of how this space evolves, and that an open-source platform is the best way to do that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our engineering team is small and productive: five engineers, one PM, and two course ops staff.  We do our own operations and QA.  We install several times per week.  We like being close to our customers
          (faculty, staff, students) since that motivates the right kind of innovation.  We run a lightweight, mostly-Agile development process with quick daily standups, group planning, and frequent demos.  We work on
          the Stanford Campus.
        </p>
        <p>
          What we work on is mostly driven by our customers, but we also commit to the core edX platform repo.  We collaborate with other OpenEdX adopters, including Google.
        </p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;</p>


        <h3><strong>Software Engineer</strong>, Office of the Vice Provost for Online Learning<br /><br /></h3>
        <p>
          We are hiring an engineer to join Stanford Online's Platform team.  Stanford has the best, the biggest, and the most on-line courses on the Internet.  This team builds and operates the open-source platform
          behind many of them.  Students on-campus and worldwide learn via our course materials and the online communities they create.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our technical stack is modern and sane:<br />
          - Python/Django, Nginx, Celery<br />
          - CSS/SASS, JS/jQuery/CoffeeScript<br />
          - Relational (MySQL) and nosql (MongoDB) storage<br />
          - Cloud hosted at Amazon: EC2, RDS, S3, ElasticCache<br />
          - Jenkins, Gerrit, and Ansible
        </p>
        <p>
          As an engineer on this team you'd be expected to work across the stack as needed.  We are looking for generalists.  If you are an engineer who sees technical variety and learning as fun challenges, then join us.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a two year fixed term position (100% FTE). The job is on the Stanford Campus, ie. being remote full-time isn't an option.  You'll need to successfully pass a background check and show you are eligible to
          work in the US before coming on board.

        <h3><strong>Course Operations Specialist</strong>, Office of the Vice Provost for Online Learning<br /><br /></h3>
        <p>
          The Course Operations Specialist will be responsible for the bedrock of support to teaching staff (instructors and teaching assistants for all of our courses) for all courses using the OpenEdX platform at Stanford.
          S/he will need to understand the ins and outs of the platform, and effectively communicate this knowledge, both in a one-on-one setting and by creating documentation. S/he will interact directly with faculty across
          a range of disciplines, to understand their needs and how their material and assessments can be best presented online. This will be an opportunity to interact with world-class faculty, and work with them on
          implementing best practices for online teaching in their courses.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the student side, s/he will triage customer support email, create appropriate FAQs, and determine when a student issue really indicates a problem and needs to be escalated.  The successful candidate will reproduce
          student and instructor-reported issues as needed, so that bugs can be crisply defined.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Course Operations Specialist works as part of the OpenEdX engineering team. S/he must be comfortable acting as the "voice of the customer" in daily and weekly engineering meetings providing insight into faculty
          and student issues with the platform.
